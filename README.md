# IntelHacks2017
This is the development software built for the Intel Hacks 2017 hackathon.

We are presenting Boxera, a smart-device that would automate the process of purchasing consumables, one example being soap. By creating a smart container that relies on a variety of sensors, we can pinpoint whether we are running low on an item and simply order it!

The device will be connected to the supplier of a specific product and whenever the amount of product is low, it would automatically order a new one. We want to push IoT past the notification to the user, and into the realm where IoT devices can be completely standalone. 

The device was meant to be an Arduino 101 with a Wifi shield to connect to the web, however it is quite hard to find the shield so we decided to use a Raspberry Pi as our wifi intermediary. It works fantastically but it adds some extra size to the enclosure of the device. 

The files for the enclosure are also available in the repo as .stl. We 3D printed them using an FDM printer in ABS material.
